[2026-01-05] bug-001: Fixed TypeScript and ESLint errors
- Changed RefObject types from RefObject<HTMLElement> to RefObject<HTMLElement | null> to match actual ref initialization
- Replaced all (window as any) with proper type: Window & { navigateToSection?: ..., setParallaxSection?: ... }
- Fixed react-hooks/set-state-in-effect by removing setState from effect (used lazy initializer instead)
- Fixed react-hooks/exhaustive-deps by moving sectionRefs inside useCallback
- All files affected: page.tsx, Dock.tsx, ParallaxBackground.tsx
- Build and lint now pass successfully ✓

Next person: All TypeScript/ESLint issues resolved. Ready for feature development.

[2026-01-05] bug-002: Fixed section transition animations
- Root cause: bug-001 removed `setActiveSection(section)` from pathname useEffect to fix ESLint warning
- This call is REQUIRED for GSAP animations to work - it triggers the re-render that animations depend on
- Restored the setActiveSection call with eslint-disable comment explaining why it's necessary
- File affected: src/app/page.tsx (lines 54-58)
- Build and lint pass successfully ✓

Next person: Section animations now work correctly. The eslint-disable on line 57 is intentional - do NOT remove the setActiveSection call!

[2026-01-05] func-001 + ui-001: Implemented Projects section with project list
- Created src/data/projects.ts with Project interface and sample data
  - Includes id, slug, title, overview, description, image, date, tags, featured, links
  - Helper functions: getFeaturedProjects(), getProjectBySlug()
- Created src/components/ui/ProjectCard.tsx with glass morphism styling
  - Uses GlassCard component with hover effects
  - Displays title, date, overview, and tags (limited to 3 with overflow indicator)
  - Gradient placeholder for images until actual images are added
- Updated src/components/sections/Projects.tsx
  - Stacked vertical layout (flex-col) with max-width container
  - GSAP staggered slide-in animations (each card slides from right with increasing delay)
  - Scrollable container for when content overflows
- All files pass TypeScript compilation and ESLint ✓

Next person: Projects section is functional with 3 featured sample projects. To add real projects:
1. Add images to /public/projects/ and update image paths in src/data/projects.ts
2. Add more projects to the array - set featured: true to show on main page
3. ui-002 (project detail pages) will add click-through functionality
