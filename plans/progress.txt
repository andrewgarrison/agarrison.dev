[2026-01-05] bug-001: Fixed TypeScript and ESLint errors
- Changed RefObject types from RefObject<HTMLElement> to RefObject<HTMLElement | null> to match actual ref initialization
- Replaced all (window as any) with proper type: Window & { navigateToSection?: ..., setParallaxSection?: ... }
- Fixed react-hooks/set-state-in-effect by removing setState from effect (used lazy initializer instead)
- Fixed react-hooks/exhaustive-deps by moving sectionRefs inside useCallback
- All files affected: page.tsx, Dock.tsx, ParallaxBackground.tsx
- Build and lint now pass successfully ✓

Next person: All TypeScript/ESLint issues resolved. Ready for feature development.
