          pursuit of perfection&quot;, is a coffee company aimed at bridging the
          gap between coffee farmers and coffee consumers. The company was

        with hopes to raise money to start and grow the company. Unfortunately,
        they were unable to raise the money, but the prototype was a tremendous
